      <h2>Tailored Car Dismantling and Shipping from Japan</h2>
      <p>
        We offer you the flexibility to choose cars directly from Japan’s main auctions, purchasing them only when they meet your specific requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our approach balances cost efficiency with securing the right vehicles without missing opportunities at auction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each car is dismantled exactly to your specifications, maximizing container space by carefully organizing and wrapping if necessary each part to prevent damage and ensure security during transport.
      </p>
      <p>
        We provide photo options at every stage—before, during, and after loading—so you have complete visibility. With us, you get a fully customized, secure, and cost-effective car dismantling and shipping service that meets your needs.
