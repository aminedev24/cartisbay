        A Message from Artisbay Inc. on Environmental Responsibility
      </p>
      <p>
        At Artisbay Inc., we’re committed to providing high-quality used tires, vehicles, and parts to our valued customers around the world. In addition to delivering excellent products, we deeply care about the impact we all have on the environment. As a part of our community, we kindly encourage you to join us in making a positive difference by handling any recycling and disposal in a way that minimizes harm to the environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        This includes ensuring the proper disposal of used tires, car oils, and spare parts, which can have significant environmental impacts if not handled responsibly. Taking these steps helps to reduce pollution, conserve resources, and promote safer practices for the planet.
      </p>
      <p>
        While we understand this isn’t a strict requirement, we ask that you do your best to adopt responsible recycling and disposal practices wherever possible. By doing so, you’re helping to create a more sustainable future for everyone.
      </p>
      <p>Thank you for your support and for considering this important aspect of our shared responsibility.</p>
