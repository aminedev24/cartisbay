                    <li>
                      A new passenger car tire typically has a tread depth of

                  <p>
                    It's important to check the legal minimum tread depth required
                    in your country, as it can vary depending on local laws. For
                    example, in Japan, the legal minimum tread depth for passenger
                    vehicles is 1.6 mm, below which tires are deemed unfit for
                    road use.

                  <strong>Practical Safety Limit:</strong>
                  <p>
                    Tires with less than 30% tread remaining may still be legal
                    but are generally unsafe for optimal performance, especially
                    in wet or challenging conditions.

                  <strong>Safety Recommendation:</strong>
                  <p>
                    Regularly checking tread depth is essential for safety, as
                    insufficient tread significantly reduces traction,
                    particularly in wet conditions.

                Tire widths typically range from about 135 mm to 335 mm for
                passenger vehicles, although specialty and performance tires may
                vary. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of common widths:

              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Narrow tires</strong>: 135 mm to 175 mm - Often found
                  on compact cars and economy vehicles.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Standard tires</strong>: 185 mm to 225 mm - Common on
                  mid-sized sedans and family vehicles.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Wider tires</strong>: 225 mm to 305 mm - Typically
                  used on sports cars and performance vehicles.

                <li>
                  <strong>Ultra-wide tires</strong>: 305 mm and above -

                When selecting tires, itâ€™s important to consider the vehicle
                specifications, driving conditions, and personal preferences for
                handling and comfort. Always consult your vehicleâ€™s manual or a
                tire specialist for the best fit.
